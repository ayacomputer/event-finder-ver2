## General info
The project is a web application which allows users to search for events in their chosen cities, and displays the locations of these events using markers on a map.

The application was created using HTML and Javascript, as well as CSS and Bulma CSS framework.

The project was motivated by the following USER STORY:
</br>
AS A person who is interested in music events
</br>
I WANT to find music events in the location of my choice,
</br>
THEN I want to see their location on a map, in relation to my searched location
</br>

## API used

</br>

## Description

<li> allows the user to search for events based on their chosen city by using the Ticketmaster API </li>
<li> displays a list of 10 events, with artist name, date and time </li>
